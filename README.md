# AwareUnit - CMS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SteelzZ/au-cmsinn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SteelzZ/au-cmsinn)

## History

###### Current version - In Development, unstable

## About

This is a CMS package for Meteor and it is bit different from other CMS systems. There is no so called "admin console", because everything is managed in frontend. Content editing, structure changes, languages, images, navigation everything is managed in a "What you see is what you can edit" kinda way. Main goal i am trying to achieve is to make it very intuitive, easy to use but at the same time powerful enough.

## Documentation

#### Getting started

To make it easy to start with I have created a sample project that uses this package. As documentation is still "In progress" :), best I can offer is a sample project.

Just create new meteor project:
``` sh
$ mrt create my-cms-project
```

and add this package:
``` sh
$ mrt add au-ui-modern-business
```

Now once you will run your project you will be presented with a "Controls block" through which you will be able to manage your website. 

## Installation

This package can be installed with [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite/). From inside a Meteorite-managed app:

``` sh
$ mrt add au-cmsinn
```
